# Global Market Responses to U.S. Federal Funds Rate Changes

This project analyzes how global equity indices respond to changes in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate using both OLS regressions and a Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework.

The analysis quantifies both immediate (contemporaneous) and dynamic (multi-month) effects of monetary policy shocks across major global markets.
